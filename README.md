## CaladanDAO

The CaladanDAO is a community effort to analyze treasuries for DAOs, Defi + NFT projects supported by [Gitcoin Grants Stack](https://bounties.gitcoin.co/grants), [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery), and OSS.

Goals:
1. analyze DAO treasuries, Defi + NFT projects, inspired by [Dune Spellbook](https://dune.com/docs/data-tables/spellbook/), but using [Google BigQuery Public Datasets](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data) as a public data warehouse for Ethereum and top EVM chains
2. host [Dune-like dashboards](https://dune.com/browse/dashboards) in a completely open source stack of [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/) + custom UI to maximize community involvement and impact
3. enable DAOs, via the [Gitcoin Allo](https://docs.allo.gitcoin.co/) protocol, to support [Web3 data wizards](https://dune.com/browse/wizards) to building DAO analytics 

This project aims to be self-referential, by which we aim to use the [Gitcoin Allo Protocol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvVG-2ZgY7w&list=PLm6V2qdPAeaUBG-qBewmpopLdgVtpqaXM&t=5s) to support CaladanDAO contributors to model itself as well as Web3 projects generally.

We are currently designing a program and are targeting the [Gitcoin Grants 18 Aug 15-29, 2023ðŸŽ‰](https://twitter.com/gitcoin/status/1681747409435787264).  Applications are open August 1.

### CaladanDAO Teams: (as of July 2023)

We envision many CaladanDAO teams being able to support Web3 Analytics.  Here are some starting contributors:

* [Colorful Notion](https://colorfulnotion.com), developers of [polkaholic.io](https://polkaholic.io) and [substrate-etl](https://github.com/colorfulnotion/substrate-etl) -- @sourabhniyogi @mkchungs
* [Blocktrekker](https://www.blocktrekker.xyz)
* [allen.day](https://allen.day) -- @allenday

## How to Apply to the Alpha Round

The Alpha Round is to support the initial Caladan developers to work together closely to develop a solid foundation for the CaladanDAO.

Design of the [Voting](https://docs.allo.gitcoin.co/core-concepts/voting-strategy) and [Payout](https://docs.allo.gitcoin.co/core-concepts/payout-strategy) is under consideration.

[***APPLY HERE***](https://builder.gitcoin.co/#/chains/1/rounds/0x4b67edda5660f952185f8db1f6f7d79e5ab218b6)

Eligibility Requirements:
1. Applicants must have a working project configuration with publicly viewable dashboards.

The dashboards must model Web3 projects, and ideally projects with a Treasury/DAOs.  Of particular interest are dashboards that _model treasuries for DAOs and NFT projects that show how much they raised and how much theyâ€™ve spent_.  Initial CaladanDAO contributors are focussed on this goal.

At present, [Sourabh Niyogi](https://github.com/sourabhniyogi) is the program manager.
